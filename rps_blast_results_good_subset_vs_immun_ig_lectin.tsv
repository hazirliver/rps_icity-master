Trichoplein or mitostatin, was first defined as a meiosis-specific nuclear structural protein. It has since been linked with mitochondrial movement. It is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane, and over-expression leads to reduction in mitochondrial motility whereas lack of it enhances mitochondrial movement. The activity appears to be mediated through binding the mitochondria to the actin intermediate filaments (IFs). The family is in the trichohyalin-plectin-homology domain.	9.87e-08

This is an N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain found in esterases such as EstA. Analysis of the EstA structure confirms that it is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase family, with a conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad. The Ig-like domain presumably plays a role in the multimerization of EstA into an unusual hexameric structure. Additionally, it may also participate in the catalysis of EstA by guiding the substrate to the active site.	1.16e-08

This is an N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain found in esterases such as EstA. Analysis of the EstA structure confirms that it is a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase family, with a conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad. The Ig-like domain presumably plays a role in the multimerization of EstA into an unusual hexameric structure. Additionally, it may also participate in the catalysis of EstA by guiding the substrate to the active site.	2.88e-09

Trichoplein or mitostatin, was first defined as a meiosis-specific nuclear structural protein. It has since been linked with mitochondrial movement. It is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane, and over-expression leads to reduction in mitochondrial motility whereas lack of it enhances mitochondrial movement. The activity appears to be mediated through binding the mitochondria to the actin intermediate filaments (IFs). The family is in the trichohyalin-plectin-homology domain.	3.66e-07

Trichoplein or mitostatin, was first defined as a meiosis-specific nuclear structural protein. It has since been linked with mitochondrial movement. It is associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane, and over-expression leads to reduction in mitochondrial motility whereas lack of it enhances mitochondrial movement. The activity appears to be mediated through binding the mitochondria to the actin intermediate filaments (IFs). The family is in the trichohyalin-plectin-homology domain.	2.74e-06
